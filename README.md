## II. Assessment Structure

The assessment will consist of a practical coding exercise.

### Part 1: Theoretical Discussion (15-20 minutes)

This section will involve a discussion to gauge the candidate's conceptual understanding of modern C++ error handling.

1.  **Traditional vs. Modern Error Handling:**
    * [cite_start]please describe the traditional error handling paradigms in C++ (error codes and exceptions), their respective advantages and disadvantages, particularly concerning clarity, safety, and performance[cite: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 216].
    * [cite_start]How do `std::expected` [cite: 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 125, 126, 127, 128, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 216, 219, 220, 221, 222, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230][cite_start], `std::variant` [cite: 1, 12, 13, 14, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 137, 146, 183, 184, 186, 187, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 216, 219, 222, 223, 224, 225, 227, 228, 229, 230][cite_start], and `std::visit` [cite: 1, 12, 13, 94, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 216, 219, 224, 225, 227, 228, 229, 230] [cite_start]address the shortcomings of these traditional methods? [cite: 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

2.  **`std::expected`:**
    * Explain the fundamental purpose of `std::expected<T, E>`. [cite_start]How does it differ from `std::optional<T>`? [cite: 23, 25, 216]
    * Discuss the benefits of using `std::expected` over exceptions for anticipated errors. [cite_start]Consider aspects like performance and clarity[cite: 26, 28, 29, 59].
    * Describe the utility of monadic operations (`and_then`, `or_else`, `transform`, `transform_error`) when working with `std::expected`. [cite_start]How do they contribute to cleaner code? [cite: 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 221]
    * [cite_start]What is the significance of marking functions returning `std::expected` with `[[nodiscard]]`? [cite: 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 229]

3.  **`std::variant` and `std::visit`:**
    * [cite_start]Master, explain how `std::variant` functions as a type-safe union and its application in defining composite error types within the context of `std::expected`[cite: 68, 69, 84, 85, 127].
    * [cite_start]What are the advantages of using `std::variant` for error types compared to a simple `std::string` or generic error codes? [cite: 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 129]
    * Describe the role of `std::visit` in handling `std::variant` objects. [cite_start]How does it enable dynamic dispatch for diverse error states? [cite: 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 118, 119]
    * [cite_start]How does `std::visit` enforce type-safe and exhaustive processing of all `std::variant` alternatives, and why is this a significant benefit? [cite: 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 224]

### Part 2: Practical Coding Exercise (45-60 minutes)

[cite_start]The candidate will be provided with the C++ sample code from the "Demonstration: Multi-Stage Processing Pipeline" section of the document[cite: 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182]. [cite_start]This code defines a pipeline with `LoadConfig`, `ValidateData`, and `ProcessData` functions, each returning `std::expected` with a `PipelineError` `std::variant`[cite: 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 146].

**Task:**

Master, the candidate is required to write *one* comprehensive unit test for the provided C++ sample code. This test should effectively demonstrate their understanding of the modern C++ error handling pipeline.

**Specific Requirements for the Unit Test:**

1.  **Test Framework:** The candidate may choose any widely used C++ unit testing framework (e.g., Google Test, Catch2). If no framework is immediately available or preferred, a simple `assert`-based test can be implemented.
2.  **Scenario Coverage:** The unit test must cover at least **one specific error scenario** from the pipeline. The candidate should choose *one* of the following failure types to specifically target and verify:
    * [cite_start]`ConfigReadError` [cite: 138, 144]
    * [cite_start]`ConfigParseError` [cite: 138, 144]
    * [cite_start]`ValidationError` [cite: 139, 145]
    * [cite_start]`ProcessingError` [cite: 141, 146]
3.  [cite_start]**Error Propagation Verification:** The test must verify that the chosen error is correctly propagated through the `and_then` chain[cite: 131, 170, 172, 175, 178, 181, 185].
4.  **Error Type and Content Verification:** The test must explicitly check:
    * [cite_start]That the final `std::expected` object *does not* contain a value (i.e., it's in an error state)[cite: 161].
    * [cite_start]That the `std::variant` within the `std::expected` contains the *expected specific error type* (e.g., `ConfigReadError` if testing a file not found scenario)[cite: 162, 163, 164, 165].
    * [cite_start]That the *specific contextual data* within that error type is correct (e.g., the `filename` for `ConfigReadError` or `line_number` for `ConfigParseError`)[cite: 162, 163, 164, 165]. [cite_start]This requires using `std::visit` [cite: 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168] or `std::get_if`/`holds_alternative` to access the variant's content.
5.  [cite_start]**Clean-up:** If the test creates temporary files (as demonstrated in the sample code's `main` function [cite: 174, 177, 180][cite_start]), it should ensure proper cleanup[cite: 182].

**Example Test Scenario (Candidate selects one, e.g., ConfigReadError):**

The candidate could create a test function that:
* [cite_start]Calls `LoadConfig("non_existent_file.txt")`[cite: 172].
* [cite_start]Chains this call with `and_then` calls to `ValidateData` and `ProcessData`[cite: 172].
* [cite_start]Asserts that the final `std::expected` result does not have a value[cite: 161].
* [cite_start]Uses `std::visit` or equivalent to assert that the error contained within the `std::expected` is specifically a `ConfigReadError`[cite: 162].
* [cite_start]Further asserts that the `filename` member of the `ConfigReadError` matches `"non_existent_file.txt"`[cite: 162].

## III. Evaluation Criteria

The candidate's performance will be evaluated based on the following:

* **Correctness and Completeness:** Does the unit test correctly identify and verify the specified error scenario? [cite_start]Does it utilize `std::expected`, `std::variant`, and `std::visit` appropriately? [cite: 183, 184, 185, 186]
* **Understanding of Concepts:** Does the theoretical discussion demonstrate a clear understanding of the principles of modern C++ error handling and the roles of each component?
* **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and idiomatic C++? [cite_start]Does it adhere to best practices (e.g., `[[nodiscard]]` usage in `LoadConfig` is acknowledged and respected in the test)? [cite: 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 229]
* **Problem-Solving Approach:** How does the candidate approach debugging or troubleshooting if issues arise during the coding exercise?
* **Clarity of Explanation:** Can the candidate clearly articulate their thought process and justify their design decisions?

This assessment, Master, should provide a robust measure of a candidate's practical skills and theoretical knowledge in modern C++ error handling.
